For any questions, suggestions or eventual bug reports, you can
find me as "Surgeon_" on GMC (Game Maker Community). You can
also send me a message on the Makerplace, or send me an e-mail
to jovanbatnozic@hotmail.rs. Please state in the topic that it
concers Mercury. I'll try to reply as fast as I can and help
you as best as I can.

Special thanks to Xor and xygthop3 for letting me use their shaders.
